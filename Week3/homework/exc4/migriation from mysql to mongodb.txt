-Create database directory.
Create the data directory where MongoDB stores data. MongoDBâ€™s default data directory path is the absolute path \data\db on the drive from which you start MongoDB.

From the Command Interpreter, create the data directories:

cd C:\
md "\data\db"

To start MongoDB, run mongod.exe.

"C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\4.4\bin\mongod.exe" --dbpath="c:\data\db"

All command-line examples in this tutorial are provided as absolute paths to the MongoDB binaries. You can add C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\4.4\bin to your System PATH and then omit the full path to the MongoDB binaries.
